            <h2> Port_Database_System</h2>
            <p>
               Port_Database project was developed to manage import and exporation processes from owner to the freight companies to the Vessels and vice versa.<br>
               The main function of the database were as follows.<br>
               The Database should effectively provide Ghana Revenue Authority with the list of containers that are ready to be cleared depending on their date clearance, the company serving as an agent to clear those goods and the items containers that are fit for clearance and those that not fit for clearance.<br>
                The Database should also be able to provide Ghana Community Network with the details of all containers that have been declared by customs office for clearance. Together with the details of all the cash payments for a tracking device that is placed on the containers. <br>
                The Database should also be able to provide all the list of receipts that were issued in a day. And the insurance companies that insured a container and the amount paid. <br>
                The Database should be able to provide the details of containers that were ship lined and charged.
                The Database should show which Terminal fro which an agent is clearing.
                The Database should have the information on all offices or departments (employees) through which an item is cleared. <br>
                The Database should be able to provide the statistics on the most active Terminal. And the total number of containers stored in a terminal.
